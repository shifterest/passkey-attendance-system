# Web Frontend Reference

The web frontend is a Next.js App Router application in `frontend/web/`. It is the **admin and teacher-facing** interface. Student check-in is handled exclusively by the Flutter app.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js App Router (React Server Components by default)
- **UI library:** shadcn/ui (`components/ui/`) + Tabler Icons (`@tabler/icons-react`)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Linting/formatting:** Biome (`pnpm biome check`)
- **API client:** `app/lib/api.ts` (typed fetch wrappers, no external HTTP client library)
- **Icons:** Tabler only — do not use Lucide

## Route Structure

All authenticated pages live inside the `(home)` route group, which provides the sidebar + header shell via `layout.tsx`. The group is entered automatically after login.

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/login` | Login landing; also handles first-run bootstrap |
| `/dashboard` | Overview: stat cards + activity chart |
| `/classes` | Class list; drill-down to sessions |
| `/classes/[class_id]/sessions` | Sessions for a specific class |
| `/students` | Student list with registration/unregister actions |
| `/teachers` | Teacher list (read-only) |
| `/records` | All attendance records |
| `/logs` | Audit event log |
| `/admins` | Admin user list |
| `/users` | Generic user list |
| `/orgs` | Organization list |
| `/orgs/[org_id]` | Organization detail: members, rules, events |
| `/orgs/[org_id]/events/[event_id]` | Event detail: attendee rules |

## `app/lib/api.ts` — API Client

### Origin resolution
- Browser: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN`
- SSR: `API_ORIGIN_SERVER ?? NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN`

### Current auth model in `api.ts`
- Browser requests attach `X-Session-Token` from localStorage.
- SSR requests attach `X-Session-Token` from the mirrored session cookie so authenticated server components can call protected backend endpoints.
- `requestAll()` handles paginated aggregation for pages that need the full dataset rather than the first page.

### Missing wrappers
The following backend areas still lack complete wrapper coverage in `api.ts`:
`openSession`, policy CRUD, enrollment CRUD, and record update (`PUT /records/{id}`)

Credential CRUD and org/event wrappers were added on the vibed branch.

---

## Page-by-Page State

### `/login` — `app/login/page.tsx`
Client component. Fetches `GET /bootstrap/status` on mount (raw `fetch`, not `api.ts`). Branches UI based on `isBootstrapMode`.

**What works:**
- Bootstrap mode detection and display
- Bootstrap token submission → `POST /bootstrap/operator` → persists session in both `localStorage` and cookie storage
- Existing-session redirect into the authenticated app shell
- Unsupported browser passkey login is explicitly disabled instead of being a dead click target

**Known gaps:**
- Browser passkey login remains disabled because the current backend login contract requires the app-layer device signature and enrolled device key, which the browser client does not provide
- Password login button is permanently inert
- API unreachability on mount is silently swallowed — no error shown
- "Register" link and ToS/Privacy links all point to `#!`

### `/dashboard`
Server component. Fetches all records and sessions through paginated helpers. Computes today's counts in-page and passes live daily aggregates to the chart component.

**Known gaps:**
- No drill-down/filter controls from the stat cards or chart yet

### `/classes/[class_id]/sessions`
Server component. Shows sessions for a class; "Back to Classes" link; no class name shown in the header.

### `/students`
Server component passthrough to `DataTableStudent`.

### `/records`
Server component. Fetches all records through paginated helpers.

**Known gaps:**
- No server-backed pagination or filter UI yet

### `/logs`
Hard 200-event cap. API supports `event_type`, `actor_id`, date-range filters — none exposed.

---

## Component-by-Component State

### `DataTableStudent` — `components/custom/data-table-student.tsx`

**What works:**
- Full-column table with filtering by role/registered/in_class
- Global search across `full_name`, `school_id`, `email`
- Column visibility toggle
- Per-row "Generate/Regenerate registration QR" → `POST /admin/register/{userId}` → QR dialog
- Registration polling (2s interval until registered)
- Per-row unregister action wired to `POST /admin/unregister/{userId}`
- Local drag-and-drop row reordering
- `router.refresh()` after registration confirmed

**Known gaps:**
- The student detail drawer is entirely commented out.

### `DataTableRecords` — `components/custom/data-table-records.tsx`

**What works:**
- Paginated table: client-side, 20/page default
- Status badge, assurance score + band label using recorded threshold snapshots, verification methods badges, flag icons (network anomaly ⚠, teacher flag 🚩, sync pending 🔄, manually approved ✓, mock GPS 🛡)

**Known gaps:**
- No actions (approval, flagging) — read-only
- User ID and session ID shown as truncated UUIDs with no name resolution
- No filter/search controls

### `ChartAreaInteractive` — `components/custom/chart-area-interactive.tsx`

Prop-driven chart component used by the dashboard. It renders live daily aggregates for total records and flagged records.

**Known gaps:**
- No range selector or drill-down interaction yet
- Still dashboard-specific rather than a reusable reporting component

### `SectionCards` — `components/custom/section-cards.tsx`

**What works:** Displays `recordsToday`, `flaggedToday`, `openSessions` passed as props from the dashboard page.

**What works:** Displays `recordsToday`, `flaggedToday`, `openSessions`, `totalSessions` passed as props from the dashboard page. 4-card grid fills all slots.

**Known gaps:**
- Cards are display-only; no click-through to filtered views

### `SearchForm` — `components/custom/search-form.tsx`

Renders a search input but is not connected to any table filtering logic. Dead UI element.

---

## Styling and Component Conventions

- Edit real app components in `components/custom/`; do not edit `components/ui/` (shadcn primitives)
- Use Tabler icons (`@tabler/icons-react`) — do not use Lucide icons anywhere
- Use Biome for linting/formatting: `pnpm biome check`
- shadcn components are added via `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>` — never edit generated shadcn files manually

---

## Missing Pages (Not Yet Built)

These are the unimplemented parts of the web UI needed for a working class-based system:

| Missing | Backend support | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Session records drill-down (records for one session) | `GET /records/by-session/{id}` | P0 |
| Manual approval UI (approve/reject low-assurance records) | `POST /records/approve` | P0 |
| Session open/close controls (teacher-initiated) | `POST /sessions/open/teacher`, `POST /sessions/{id}/close` | P0 |
| Student detail page / per-student attendance history | `GET /records/by-user/{id}` | P1 |
| Class policy management (thresholds, PI toggle, timing) | `ClassPolicy` endpoints | P1 |
| Enrollment management (add/remove students from classes) | `/enrollments` endpoints | P1 |
| Credential revocation UI | `DELETE /credentials/{id}` | P1 |
| Audit log filters (event type, date range) | query params on `GET /audit/` | P2 |
| Search form wired to tables | client-side filter | P2 |

### Implemented on vibed branch

| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/orgs` | Organization list with create/delete dialogs |
| `/orgs/[org_id]` | Organization detail: members (add/revoke with role selectors), rules (add/delete with rule type selector), events (create/delete + link to event detail) |
| `/orgs/[org_id]/events/[event_id]` | Event detail: attendee rule CRUD with back-to-org link |
| 4th dashboard card | "Total sessions" card added to SectionCards |
| Scaffold cleanup | Dead `chartData`/`chartConfig` exports and commented-out `TableCellViewer` removed from `data-table-student.tsx` |

---

## Auth State (Current Gap)

Authenticated browser requests now use `X-Session-Token` from localStorage, and authenticated SSR requests use the mirrored session cookie. This is sufficient for the current bootstrap-backed web flow.

The remaining auth constraint is architectural, not transport-related: browser passkey login is still disabled because the backend login flow expects the app-layer device signature and enrolled device key that exist only on the mobile client today.
